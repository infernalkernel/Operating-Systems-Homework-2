The fastest algorithm is SRJF. The turnaround time (the total time from arrival to completion) for each process is often reduced in SRJF scheduling compared to FIFO or 
non-preemptive SJF because the system continuously adapts to process the shortest remaining tasks. This dynamic adjustment leads to faster processing of the overall workload.
